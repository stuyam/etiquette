## Table Setting

### Silverware
The number of letters in the utensil should match that of the side that the utensil should go on.
1. LEFT is 4 letters, FORK is 4 lefts, so the fork goes to the left of the plate.
2. RIGHT is 5 letters, KNIFE and SPOON are 5 letters, so the knife and spoon go to the right of the plate.
3. If you have multiple spoons or forks, the bigger the spoon or form, the closer it is to the plate. Think of it like it tapers from the center where the plate is to the smallest things on the left and right.

### Napkin
1. Napkin goes under the fork(s).

### Bread & Drink
If you hold you hands in front of you, touch your pointer finger to your thumb, and extend you other fingers. They will make a 'b' and a 'd'.
1. The hand that makes a 'b' (left) will be the side the _b_read plate will go on.
2. The hand that makes a 'd' (right) will be the side the _d_rink will go on.
